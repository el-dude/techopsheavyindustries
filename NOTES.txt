### Notes

# Eventually the static HTML will be generated with Go I wrote to build static sites with MarkDown templates

1. need Terraform to create the infra for the site.
  - Create s3 bucket
  - Set the S3 bucketâ€™s ACL, policy, and static website hosting configurations
  - Create ACM ssl cert
  - Create a Cloudfront distribution with origin set to the above-created bucket
  - Set up various Cloudfront configurations like cache/restrictions etc.
  - Update the S3 bucket policy to have access via the above created Cloudfront distribution
  - create pipeline that will be used to upload site files to s3 bucket
2. Pipeline steps
  - webhook for repo
  - step one lint files
  - copy files into bucket
